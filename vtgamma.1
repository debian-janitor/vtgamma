.SH NAME
vtgamma \- set gamma correction on text terminals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vtgamma
.RI [ -x ] " <gamma>"
.br
.B vtgamma
.RI [ -x ] " <red gamma> <green gamma> <blue gamma>"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vtgamma
allows you to set the gamma correction on Linux console.  It also works on
certain terminal emulators as well.  This is usually useful on aged CRT
monitors, which tend to rapidly lose the luminance-to-voltage ratio.  Even
after just 2-3 years, typical CRT often needs gamma of as much as 1.6 to
resemble a new one.  The author of this words has seen a specimen that
needed gamma of 2 2 6 (ie, with a big loss of blue) despite still having
razor-sharp display.

Gamma correction is given as a positive floating-point number, with 1.0 being
the default.

.RB "To affect the login prompt, it's best to: " "vtgamma"
.I 1.6
.BR ">>/etc/issue" ", where "
.IR 1.6 " is the gamma correction you want."

The color profile lasts either until the next time a program resets the terminal.
While this is quite a rare thing, it happens, and thus you'll probably want to
have the gamma refreshed every time a program exits.  The most effective way to
do so is to edit your
.B ~/.bashrc
and include the output of
.BI "vtgamma -e " 1.6
.RB "in " PS1 ", enclosed between " \e[ " and " \e] "."
.RB "Unfortunately, the " "Midnight Commander" " can't cope well with prompts"
containing such codes, thus you may want to prefer to set
.B PROMPT_COMMAND
instead:
.br
.HP
.I PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\ee]P0000000..."'
.HP 0
This is only a notch slower (as
.I echo
is a bash builtin), and it obviously beats running vtgamma every single time.
